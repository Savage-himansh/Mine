With two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled, you'll need to use a second factor when accessing GitHubthrough your browser. When you first configure 2FA, your account will enter a check up period for 28 days to ensure your account's 2FA methods are setup correctly. You can exit the check up period by successfully performing 2FA within 28 days. If you don't authenticate within 28 days, you'll be asked to perform 2FA inside one of your existing GitHub sessions. If you cannot perform 2FA to pass the 28th day checkup, use the provided shortcut to reconfigure your 2FA settings and retain access to GitHub. For more information, see Configuring two-factor authentication.
